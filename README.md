<h1>Hack the Ridge WINNER</h1>
<p>Dec 9, 2023</p>
<p>Received Best Female Hack out of 140 participants!</p>

<h2>Inspiration</h2>
Our program was inspired by the issues many language learners have gotten during their learning process. A vital component of learning a language is the build-up of vocabulary, and many language learners have issues with it. While Wordle is a great game that helped many English learners to improve their vocabulary while also having fun. We were inspired to create a game similar to Wordle, but in many other languages besides English, which would be played for learning another language that the players want to learn.

<h2>What it does</h2>
The program has multiple languages available to the player and the player would need to guess the 5 letter word in the language they chose. (Similar to Wordle)

<h2>How we built it</h2>
We used Python and Pygame to build the game.

<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>
Time limitation, especially for a hackathon with less than 12 hours to create the program.

<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>
This idea that we thought of.

<h2>What we learned</h2>
The use of time management.

<h2>What's next for Lingule</h2>
Have more languages available to the users.
Include spellchecking that determines if the words entered are valid where the player can play with words added by other players.
Have the translated language more than just English.
Have a website with daily new words.
